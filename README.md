Instructions to run the project are as follows:-
1. clone the repo in your system,
2. open project in VScode or in other IDE,
3. run "npm install" in terminal if node modules folder is not there in your project,
4. run "npm install express mysql2 dotenv typescript ts-node nodemon copyfiles fs-extra cors body-parser" this command if you get any error (this is optional),
5. finally run "npm start" to run your project.
